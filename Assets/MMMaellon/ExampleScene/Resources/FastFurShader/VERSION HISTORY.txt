-------------------
New Features:
	- 'Length Masks'
	- Now supports .dds textures
	- Standard version Quality Settings can choose between 16, 24, or 32 maximum fur layers

	- Adjustable hair map filtering
	- (Experimental) 'Advanced Hair Colouring' supports various ways of having hairs change colour along their length

Bug fixes:
	- The 'FastFurShader' folder can now be moved. It doesn't need to be in the root 'Assets' folder anymore.
	- Eliminated most pixel "fireflies"
	- Render quality is now consistent with groomed fur height (ex. 0.5 height fur groomed to 50% length will now have the same detail as 0.25 height fur groomed to 100% length)
	- Dynamic Quality Settings often did not work correctly (when taking a photo, screenshot, etc...)
	- Fur quality should be more consistent when scaled
	- The maximum view distance wasn't accurate
	- Sometimes more layers were being rendered than needed
	- Fur layers weren't smoothly appearing at long ranges
	- Fur layers were shrinking a bit too much at long view ranges
	- Fur Grooming: Fixed non-skinned mesh renderer support
	- Fur Grooming: 'Show Data' wasn't working if the material's properties were not showing in the inspector.

	- Shadows weren't accurate, which was causing glitches
	- Negative Fur Markings Height Offset now works correctly
	- Fixed a glitch that made subsurface scattering look patchy when far away
	- Anisotropic angle was x10 too high. This mostly affected Refractions, making them 60 degrees instead of 6, which made their appearance very weak.
	- 'Fur Shape Data Map Utilities' copy command was sometimes stuck inverting
	- Fixed various bugs and glitches with the shader GUI

Changes:
	- Adjusted the min/max render range and the render detail
	- Hairs are now MUCH more visible when further away.
	- Shadows have been completely re-worked. They now use a variant of the Unity Standard Shader's shadow caster.
	- Default shadow thickness is now 0.4 instead of 0.25
	- Quality Settings have been completly re-worked
	- Default for standard version is now 24 layers (max is still 32)
	- Default VR Quality is now 'Very Fast 125'
	- 'Override Quality Bias' now matches the scale of the quality options. For example:, 'Very Fast 110' plus a bias of 20 results in a quality of 130
	- Maximum view distance is now proportional to fur height (with a max cap of ~10 in-game meters)
	- Pipeline options have been renamed

	- Skin layer: Metallic Reflections
	- Skin layer: Occlusion Map
	- "Fallback Lighting" that will be used if a world doesn't have a "DIRECTIONAL" light
	- Adjustable "Fur Shadow Size" allows fur to cast shadows. Note that this is an approximation, so it will cause some shadow artifacts.
	- Selectable render Pipeline (V2 is currently the "live" release version)
	- Fur Grooming: Show the raw length/density/combing data using false colour
	- Texture Utilities: Apply Fur Masking, Copy/Remap Colour Channels, Rescale Length/Density/Combing, Change Resolution.

Changes:
	- The overall shape of the fur is more consistent at different ranges
	- The fur casts shadows (previously, only the skin did)
	- Fur Grooming: The UI scaling now has a maximum limit





V3.2.0 - 2022.11.08
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Some AMD GPU drivers are still crashing (6600xt and 6800xt this time), so the shader has again been reverted to the V2 pipeline
	- Added filtering to reduce the appearance of stray pixels that sometimes float above the fur at certain angles

Changes:
	- Reduced max layers back to 32 (16 for Lite)




V3.1.0 - 2022.11.06

Changes:
	- Fur Calibration can now be manually adjusted
	- View distance is now also controlled by the quality setting
	- "Body Expansion when Far" has been completely re-worked to be much smoother
	- "Min Brightness" feature has been replaced by "Extra Lighting" (which can do the same thing, plus more)
	- Fur Grooming can now be placed into the root of the scene, you don't need to put in on your avatar
	- Lots of various UI changes




V2.4.0 - 2022.10.15

	- Anisotropic light reflections.
	- Curly fur.
	- Emission that uses the Albedo Map.
	- Adjustable minimum and maximum lighting brightness.

	- "Hair Density" can now be set as low as 0.1
	- Data files are now generated in the project root directory, rather than the FastFurShader folder.




V2.3.0 - 2022.10.03 - VERSION # REVERT
--------------------------------------
Reversion:
	- There are reports of the V3.0.x pipeline crashing AMD Vega 64 cards. The pipeline changes have been reverted.

Bug fixes:
	- Includes all bug fixes from V3.0.x
	- Automatic calibration was broken (again).

Changes:
	- Includes all non-pipeline changes from V3.0.x
	- Reverting to the earlier pipeline limits the Standard shader to 32 layers and the Lite shader to 16 layers.
	- The shader supports manual calibration if automatic calibration fails.




V3.0.1 - 2022.10.02
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Skin was turning black/white. The MatCap was turning itself on if you had previously used Poiyomi's shader on the material.

Changes:
	- MatCap now must be actively turned on before it does anything.




V3.0.0 - 2022.10.02
-------------------
New Features:
	- The Max Fur Layers have been doubled for both the Standard and Lite shaders, and are now adjustable.
	- MatCap for the skin layer.

Bug fixes:
	- The automatic calibration was sometimes getting stuck in an endless loop, causing the GUI to become erratic and unusable.
	- Reverted Vertex lighting code to an earlier version to hopefully fix an intermittent compiler error.

Changes:
	- The render pipeline has been overhauled, removing a major memory and bandwidth bottleneck.
	- Length calibration is no longer automatic. It now requires the user to click a calibration button.
	- Hair Clipping has been re-calibrated. Previously, setting this to 0 still resulted in some Hair Clipping.
	- Dynamic Body Size is now less puffy-looking.




V2.2.0 - 2022.09.24
-------------------
New Features:
	- "PBS Skin Material" (only affects the skin layer): Normal Map, Metallic Map, Smoothness, and Specular Highlights.
	- "Fur Min Height Cutoff" treats any fur below the cutoff as zero height.

Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming will now use any camera (not just "Main Camera") and report an error if it cannot find one.
	- Fixed some lighting errors.
	- Shader properties can now be edited during Fur Grooming.
	- Albedo and emission colours now work with VR Chat's shader fallback system.
	- Reduced the likelihood of black lines appearing on seams during Fur Grooming.

Changes:
	- Changed "Main Maps" to "Main Render Settings", since it now includes more than just the albedo and emission maps.
	- Dynamic Body Size has been tweaked to (hopefully) make the transition smoother and less noticeable.
	- Emission system has been modified to work more like the Unity Standard shader.




V2.1.2 - 2022.09.16
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Fog is fixed.
	- Shorter-haired avatars were having their fur culled too aggressively, resulting in the fur popping in and out at medium view ranges.




V2.1.1 - 2022.09.15
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Fog is turning the skin white in some worlds. Temporarily disabled the fog.




V2.1.0 - 2022.09.11
-------------------
New Features:
	- Toon shading.
	- Wind gusts.

Bug fixes:
	- Wind could cause visible gaps to appear at geometric hard-edges.
	- "Hair Highlights" did not work if there was no optional "Fur Markings" texture.
	- The wind would sometimes stop working if you stayed in the same VR Chat room for longer than ~27 hours.

Changes:
	- Re-organized editor GUI.
	- Dynamic Body Size (added in V2.0.Beta.1), is now optional, since it can cause visible gaps on some avatars.
	- Layer spacing is a bit more spread out near the skin and a bit more compressed further away.
	- "Hair highlights" now measures all channels, instead of only the red channel, when calculating the highlight intensity.




V2.0.0.Beta.4 - 2022.08.28
--------------------------
New Features:
	- "Hair Stiffness" controls how flexible or stiff the hairs are: flexible hairs bend along their entire length, while stiff hairs bend at their root.

Bug fixes:
	- Setting the "Fur Markings Height Offset" to exactly 0 resulted in half-height fur.
	- The shader instancing has been re-built from scratch. This hopefully fixes a rare bug that sometimes caused the shader to fail to compile.

Changes:
	- Gravity and Wind moved to a "Gravity, Wind, and Movement" section, which will also have Movement settings in a future version.
	- Hairs that are bent by Gravity or Wind now retain their length, rather than sometimes being stretched or compressed.

Other:
	- The distribution package now contains a couple of custom helper shaders that I made that have been useful on my own avatars.




V2.0.0.Beta.3 - 2022.08.22
--------------------------
New Features:
	- The "Debugging" section now has properties that can be used to manually override the scaling or the maximum view distance.

Bug fixes:
	- The fur thickness still wasn't scaling correctly, due to circular logic.
	- The Fur Grooming now provides more error messages describing exactly why it has failed, rather than just not working.

Changes:
	- Fur scaling is now calibrated manually at edit time, rather than dynamically at run-time.
	- Occlusion effect is now exponential instead of linear.




V2.0.0.Beta.2 - 2022.08.17
--------------------------
New Features:
	- Added "Body Shrink Offset", which shrinks your avatar's geometry proportionally to the fur depth. This is to allow your avatar to have a sillouette that is similar to when it is using a different shader.

Bug fixes:
	- The fur thickness wasn't scaling correctly for some avatars.

Changes:
	- The wind turbulence reacts to movement relative to the wind direction and speed, rather than any movement (still needs work).




V2.0.0.Beta.1 - 2022.08.14
--------------------------
New Features:
	- Render Quality Options: Fastest, Fast, Slow, Very Slow, Slowest. (V1.2.2 speed is about equal to "Fast". "Slowest" is about half the speed of "Fast".).
	- Render Distance Options: Very Close, Close, Far, Very Far, Maximum Distance. (V1.2.2 distance is about equal to "Close". "Maximum Distance" is about double the distance of "Close".).
	- Fur Grooming now has an optional 2D cursor (makes shaving mouth, whiskers, etc... much easier).
	- Simulated sub-surface light scattering when the avatar is between the viewer and an "important" light source.

Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming doesn't break when saving.
	- Fixed another, rarer shadow "sparkle" glitch.

Changes:
	- Internally, the codebase has been completely overhauled.
	- Improved algorithm for determining how much detail to render. Overall render quality is higher (without being any slower).
	- More speed optimizations.
	- The thickness of the fur now scales with the avatar scale.
	- The base skin layer is now thicker when far away. This is to maintain consistent avatar "fluffiness" even when the fur is not rendering.




V1.2.2 - 2022.08.06
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming "Strength" slider had no effect when combing.
	- Under certain lighting conditions the shadows could "sparkle".




V1.2.1 - 2022.08.01
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Fixed the Fur Grooming middle-mouse-button texture sampling.




V1.2.0 - 2022.07.30
-------------------
New Features:
	- Simulated wind.
	- Supports world fog.

Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming no longer crashes if VRChat SDK is not installed.

Changes:
	- Several more significant speed optimizations.
	- Increased render detail around edges.




V1.1.0 - 2022.06.11
-------------------
New Features:
	- Supports light emission textures.

Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming now works correctly on surfaces which reuse textures in multiple places.
	- Brush falloff is now consistent at different brush strengths.

Changes:
	- The combing brush is now much smoother and allows for finer adjustments.




V1.0.2 - 2022.06.08
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming now works with blendshapes and posed bones.

Changes:
	- Fur Grooming doesn't centre the avatar anymore (not needed anymore, after bug fix).




V1.0.1 - 2022.06.07
-------------------
Bug fixes:
	- Fur Grooming wasn't working unless the material being groomed was the first submesh of the mesh.
	- Fur Grooming wasn't working with non-centred avatars. The current workaround is that the avatar is now automatically centred.
	- Fur Grooming camera was clipping when up close.
	- The hair was clipping if there was no "Fur Markings" map.
	- "FastFur-DensityCheck.shader" wasn't compiling (but no features need it yet).

Changes:
	- Fur Grooming now automatically centres the avatar.
	- Fur Grooming now repositions the camera to face the avatar when starting up.




V1.0.0 - 2022.06.05
-------------------
	- Initial release
