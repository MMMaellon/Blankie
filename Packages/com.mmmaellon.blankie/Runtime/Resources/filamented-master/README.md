# Filamented Standard
A transposal of the shaders from Filament over the framework of Unity's Standard shader.

*Filament is a real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows,
and WebGL. It is designed to be as small as possible and as efficient as possible on Android.*

This repo is based on Filament v1.9.23.

It supports more shading models than Standard and follows a less rigid structure. This project's goal is to combine the familiar interface of the Standard shader with a shading model that's more up to date and less idiosyncratic. 

## Installation

Download the repository. Then place the folder with the shader into your Assets/ directory.

## Usage

Currently, only the features of the Standard shader are supported. The next goal is to add an interface for enabling the other modes (clear coat and anisotropy) and other shading models.
